# CW-2-CS

The aim of this assignment is to write a parameterized simulator that models a
cache. The simulator, written in C, will read a memory address trace and provide
various statistics for the cache. An outline of the simulator is provided in mem sim.c file.

The simulator will implement a parametrized cache with a configurable size, associativity and replacement policy.
